The migration guide and original documentation is below. Migration \u00b6 MDC-Android Compose Theme Adapters have moved from: * The compose-theme-adapter artifact to the accompanist/themeadapter-material artifact * The compose-theme-adapter-3 artifact to the accompanist/themeadapter-material3 artifact * The compose-theme-adapter-core artifact to the accompanist/themeadapter-core artifact The implementations are identical but the dependencies and import packages have changed. Migration steps \u00b6 Change any dependencies from: com.google.android.material:compose-theme-adapter:<mdcThemeAdapterVersion> to com.google.accompanist:accompanist-themeadapter-material:<accompanistVersion> com.google.android.material:compose-theme-adapter-3:<mdcThemeAdapter3Version> to com.google.accompanist:accompanist-themeadapter-material3:<accompanistVersion> com.google.android.material:compose-theme-adapter-core:<mdcThemeAdapterCoreVersion> to com.google.accompanist:accompanist-themeadapter-core:<accompanistVersion> Change any imports from: com.google.android.material.composethemeadapter.* to com.google.accompanist.themeadapter.material.* com.google.android.material.composethemeadapter3.* to com.google.accompanist.themeadapter.material3.* com.google.android.material.composethemeadapter.core.* to com.google.accompanist.themeadapter.core.* Original Docs \u00b6 A library that enables reuse of Material Components for Android XML themes for theming in Jetpack Compose . Usage \u00b6 There are two artifacts available: com.google.android.material:compose-theme-adapter Compatible with Compose Material Includes MdcTheme com.google.android.material:compose-theme-adapter-3 Compatible with Compose Material 3 Includes Mdc3Theme repositories { google () } dependencies { // Compatible with Compose Material, includes MdcTheme implementation \"com.google.android.material:compose-theme-adapter:<version>\" // Compatible with Compose Material 3, includes Mdc3Theme implementation \"com.google.android.material:compose-theme-adapter-3:<version>\" } See the releases page for the latest versions. Compose Material \u00b6 The basis of Material Design 2 theming in Jetpack Compose is the MaterialTheme composable, where you provide Colors , Typography and Shapes instances containing your styling parameters: MaterialTheme ( colors = colors , typography = type , shapes = shapes ) { // M2 Surface, Scaffold, etc. } Material Components for Android themes allow for similar theming for views via XML theme attributes, like so: <style name= \"Theme.MyApp\" parent= \"Theme.MaterialComponents.DayNight\" > <!-- Material 2 color attributes --> <item name= \"colorPrimary\" > @color/purple_500 </item> <item name= \"colorSecondary\" > @color/green_200 </item> <!-- Material 2 type attributes--> <item name= \"textAppearanceBody1\" > @style/TextAppearance.MyApp.Body1 </item> <item name= \"textAppearanceBody2\" > @style/TextAppearance.MyApp.Body2 </item> <!-- Material 2 shape attributes--> <item name= \"shapeAppearanceSmallComponent\" > @style/ShapeAppearance.MyApp.SmallComponent </item> </style> This library attempts to bridge the gap between Material Components for Android M2 XML themes, and themes in Jetpack Compose , allowing your composable MaterialTheme to be based on the Activity 's XML theme: MdcTheme { // MaterialTheme.colors, MaterialTheme.typography, MaterialTheme.shapes // will now contain copies of the Context's theme } This is especially handy when you're migrating an existing app, a Fragment (or other UI container) at a time. Caution If you are using an AppCompat (i.e. non-MDC) theme in your app, you should use AppCompat Compose Theme Adapter instead, as it attempts to bridge the gap between AppCompat XML themes, and M2 themes in Jetpack Compose . Customizing the M2 theme \u00b6 The MdcTheme() function will automatically read the host Context 's MDC theme and pass them to MaterialTheme on your behalf, but if you want to customize the generated values, you can do so via the createMdcTheme() function: val context = LocalContext . current val layoutDirection = LocalLayoutDirection . current var ( colors , typography , shapes ) = createMdcTheme ( context = context , layoutDirection = layoutDirection ) // Modify colors, typography or shapes as required. // Then pass them through to MaterialTheme... MaterialTheme ( colors = colors , typography = type , shapes = shapes ) { // Rest of M2 layout } Limitations \u00b6 There are some known limitations with the implementation at the moment: This relies on your Activity / Context theme extending one of the Theme.MaterialComponents themes. Text colors are not read from the text appearances by default. You can enable it via the setTextColors function parameter. Variable fonts are not supported in Compose yet, meaning that the value of android:fontVariationSettings are currently ignored. MDC ShapeAppearances allow setting of different corner families (cut, rounded) on each corner, whereas Compose's Shapes allows only a single corner family for the entire shape. Therefore only the app:cornerFamily attribute is read, others ( app:cornerFamilyTopLeft , etc) are ignored. You can modify the resulting MaterialTheme in Compose as required, but this only works in Compose. Any changes you make will not be reflected in the Activity theme. Compose Material 3 \u00b6 The basis of Material Design 3 theming in Jetpack Compose is the MaterialTheme composable, where you provide ColorScheme , Typography and Shapes instances containing your styling parameters: MaterialTheme ( colorScheme = colorScheme , typography = typography , shapes = shapes ) { // M3 Surface, Scaffold, etc. } Material Components for Android themes allow for similar theming for views via XML theme attributes, like so: <style name= \"Theme.MyApp\" parent= \"Theme.Material3.DayNight\" > <!-- Material 3 color attributes --> <item name= \"colorPrimary\" > @color/purple_500 </item> <item name= \"colorSecondary\" > @color/purple_700 </item> <item name= \"colorTertiary\" > @color/green_200 </item> <!-- Material 3 type attributes--> <item name= \"textAppearanceBodyLarge\" > @style/TextAppearance.MyApp.BodyLarge </item> <item name= \"textAppearanceBodyMedium\" > @style/TextAppearance.MyApp.BodyMedium </item> <!-- Material 3 shape attributes--> <item name= \"shapeAppearanceCornerSmall\" > @style/ShapeAppearance.MyApp.CornerSmall </item> </style> This library attempts to bridge the gap between Material Components for Android M3 XML themes, and themes in Jetpack Compose , allowing your composable MaterialTheme to be based on the Activity 's XML theme: Mdc3Theme { // MaterialTheme.colorScheme, MaterialTheme.typography, MaterialTheme.shapes // will now contain copies of the Context's theme } This is especially handy when you're migrating an existing app, a Fragment (or other UI container) at a time. Customizing the M3 theme \u00b6 The Mdc3Theme() function will automatically read the host Context 's MDC theme and pass them to MaterialTheme on your behalf, but if you want to customize the generated values, you can do so via the createMdc3Theme() function: val context = LocalContext . current var ( colorScheme , typography , shapes ) = createMdc3Theme ( context = context ) // Modify colorScheme, typography or shapes as required. // Then pass them through to MaterialTheme... MaterialTheme ( colorScheme = colorScheme , typography = typography , shapes = shapes ) { // Rest of M3 layout } Limitations \u00b6 There are some known limitations with the implementation at the moment: This relies on your Activity / Context theme extending one of the Theme.Material3 themes. Text colors are not read from the text appearances by default. You can enable it via the setTextColors function parameter. Variable fonts are not supported in Compose yet, meaning that the value of android:fontVariationSettings are currently ignored.
